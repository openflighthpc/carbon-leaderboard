  question: 'What is the OpenFlight Carbon Leaderboard?'
} do %>
  <p>
    The <%= render 'link', locals: { text: 'OpenFlight Carbon Leaderboard', link: '/leaderboard' } %>&nbsp;is
    a community initiative aiming to provide a simple methodology and clear comparison
    of <em>Carbon Impact Estimates</em> for a range of servers while adding a light
    competitive edge. This service should be used to help get an understanding of the
    impact of resources (both physical and virtual) at various levels of load.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently the Carbon Leaderboard supports physical & virtual devices running Linux.

<%= render 'faq', locals: {
  question: 'How Are Carbon Figures Estimated?'
} do %>
  <p>
    This project utilises the
    <%= render 'link', locals: { text: 'Boavizta API', link: 'https://doc.api.boavizta.org/' } %>&nbsp;for
    performing calculations based off of system. specifications and collected carbon
    impact reports (from manufacturers).
  </p>
  <p>
    This project uses the <em>Global Warming Potential (GWP)</em> metric to identify the
    <em>Carbon Equivalent</em> of the system specifications at run time (this means that
    estimations of impact of hardware manufacturer are <strong>not</strong> included in the value).
    This value is provided in kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per hour
    (kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq/hr).
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information on the intricacies of the estimate, please refer to the
    <%= render 'link', locals: { text: 'Boavizta project documentation', link: 'https://doc.api.boavizta.org/' } %>.
  </p>
<% end %>
<%= render 'faq', locals: {
  question: 'How Are Devices Ranked?'
} do %>
  <p>
    Devices in the leaderboard are ranked based on the kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq/hr per core.
    Comparing on a per-core basis means that the leaderboard won't skew based on size of
    resources but will instead use a fairer method for clearer insight.
  </p>
<% end %>
<%= render 'faq', locals: {
  question: 'How Do I Submit Data?'
} do %>
  <p>
    Data can be submitted by running the <em>Carbon Client</em> script. More information about how
    to run this script can be found
    <%= render 'link', locals: { text: 'here', link: '/', same_tab: true } %>.
  </p>
<% end %>
<%= render 'faq', locals: {
  question: 'Are the Values Accurate?'
} do %>
  <p>
    Calculating carbon equivalent impacts is not a simple procedure and takes in multiple factors:
    <ul>
      <li>Manufacturer's reports on hardware</li>
      <li>Cleanliness of the power to a country</li>
      <li>Available information on the reported hardware</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the values are merely estimates to the best of the ability of the Boavizta
    service (which has put considerable effort and transparency into their methodology which
    can be read about
    <%= render 'link', locals: { text: 'on their website', link: 'https://doc.api.boavizta.org/q%26a/' } %>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Things that are not currently considered by the leaderboard:
    <ul>
      <li>The cleanliness of the power source to the data-centre housing the servers</li>
      <li>Impact of the manufacture of the hardware</li>
      <li>Any initiatives taken to offset carbon</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<% end %>
<%= render 'faq', locals: {
  question: 'How Are Virtual Devices Estimated?'
} do %>
  <p>
    The estimation of virtual devices is still in early estimation and will improve over time.
    One of the main complexities in estimating the impact of virtual resources is through
    knowing the hardware that hosts the virtual system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some initial understanding of the hardware backing AWS instances is implemented in the
    underlying API which allows for a better estimation in the impact of those resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    For other platforms (e.g. Azure, GCP, OpenStack), the underlying hardware is not known or is
    bespoke as is the case with private cloud solutions, such as OpenStack.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has been observed that estimations for virtual resources on OpenStack have seemed higher
    than expected because OpenStack will, by default, provide very little CPU layout information
    to instances. This leads to each core that a VM has being seen as a separate physical CPU.
    With more physical CPUs this will largely inflate the carbon estimates for the virtual system.
    It is possible to address this issue on an OpenStack deployment by

    } %>.
